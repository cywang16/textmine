 
 Steps to create and test query categorization

 1. Run bld_qcat.pl to create the qu_cat_temp.txt file

 2. Run bld_nnet.pl to create the qu_categories.txt file

 3. Load the qu_categories file into the qu_categories DB table

 4. Run the qu_test.pl to test query categorization

 5. Run se_test.pl to test sentence extraction

 Files			Description
 -----			---------------------------------------------------
 bld_nnet.pl		Build the neural net weights and creare the
                        qu_categories file
 bld_qcat.pl		Create the qu_cat_temp.txt using the training.txt
 perlfaq.pl		Load the perl faq into a table
 pfile			File of patterns for bld_nnet.pl
 plot_data.pl		Dump data to create plots for sigmoid function
 qu_filecheck.pl	Verify the format of the question training file
 qu_perlfaq.dat		List of Perl FAQ questions and attributes
 qu_test.pl		Script to evaluate query classification
 se_test.pl		Test sentence extraction using HTML files from a query
 testing.txt		Questions for evaluating query categorization
 training.txt		Questions for training the query categorizer

 Notes:

 Training with more noisy data was not successful. Miscellaneous category
 could not be identified and the category was misclassified in many 
 cases. The neural net for several categories did not converge when
 a larger training set of 750 questions was used.
