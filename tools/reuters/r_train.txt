BankAmerica stock fell this week, along with other banking issues, on the news that <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE> has suspended interest payments on a large portion of its foreign debt.
billion dlrs in Brazilian loans, stands to lose 15-20 mln dlrs if the interest rate is reduced on the debt, and as much as 200 mln dlrs if <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE> pays no interest for a year, said Joseph Arsenio, analyst with Birr, Wilson and Co.
With other major banks standing to lose even more than BankAmerica if <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE> fails to service its debt, the analysts said they expect the debt will be restructured, similar to way Mexico's debt was, minimizing losses to the creditor banks.

<PLACE>Venezuela</PLACE> and its bank advisory committee have agreed in principle on revisions to the terms of a 21 billion dlr debt-rescheduling package signed last February, bankers said.
The interest rate on the rescheduling was originally set at 1-1/8 pct over Eurodollar rates, but <PLACE>Venezuela</PLACE> requested easier terms because of a 40 pct drop in oil income last year.
It also asked for a reduction in the repayments it was due to make in 1987, 1988 and 1989 - after an earlier request that it make no amortizations at all in those years was rebuffed - and sought a commitment from the banks to finance new investment in <PLACE>Venezuela</PLACE>.
While the sudden progress is to some extent coincidental, bankers acknowledge a desire to chalk up some quick successes after the shock of <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE>'s unilateral interest suspension last Friday.
By striking swift deals, banks hope to reduce the incentive for other debtors to emulate <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE>.
The Tower Commission report, which says President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> was ignorant about much of the Iran arms deal, just about ends his prospects of regaining political dominance in Washington, political analysts said. "
In one of the most direct criticisms, board chairman John Tower, a longtime <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> supporter and former Republican senator from Texas, told a press conference, "The president clearly did not understand the nature of this operation."
The report, which lent credence to widespread opinion in Washington that <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> is not in full command of the government, was particularly damaging because it was prepared by a board of the Republican president's own choosing.
What can we say except 'we're sorry, we won't do it again'?" The strategist, who works for one of his party's top 1988 presidential contenders and asked not to be identified, said the report was like "an anvil falling on us." Hess, with the Brookings Institution public policy study group, said the report is the final blow to <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s hopes of regaining the upper hand he once had in dealings with Congress, the press and the Washington bureaucracy.
Regan, expected to resign or be fired shortly, was savaged for allegedly failing both to help <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> conduct the Iran initiative and to avoid "chaos" in the disclosure process.
While <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> retains considerable constitutional powers, including command of the armed forces and the right to veto legislation, analysts say it will be difficult for him to retake control of the country's policy agenda -- particularly with Congress controlled by the Democrats.
The crucial remaining question, they said, is whether the man in the street will forsake <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> over the affair.
A Los Angeles Times poll released earlier this week showed that just 37 pct of those surveyed thought <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> was in control of the government, but 55 pct still thought he was doing a good job as president.
American Enterprise Institute analyst William Schneider, a Democrat, says <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s loss of support among Washington power brokers could be offset by continued backing of the public. "
<PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> will again plead his case that way in a televised address next week.
Analysts also point out that <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s personal popularity has not always translated into public backing for his policies.
Secretary of State George Shultz acknowledged failings in the <PLACE>Iran</PLACE> arms affair but declared he would not resign.
In 1984 and 1985 <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE>'s annual trade surpluses had been sufficient to cover the 12 billion dlrs needed to service its 109 billion dlr foreign debt.
The <PLACE>Panama</PLACE> Canal Commission, a U.S. government agency, said in its daily operations report that there was a backlog of 39 ships waiting to enter the canal early today.
mln dlrs in credit guarantees previously earmarked to cover sales of dry edible beans to <PLACE>Honduras</PLACE> have been switched to cover sales of white corn, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
<PLACE>Argentina</PLACE> could suspend payments on its foreign debt if creditor banks reject a 2.15 billion dlr loan request to meet 1987 growth targets, ruling Radical Party Deputy Raul Baglini told a local radio station. "
<PLACE>Argentina</PLACE> does not discard the use of (a moratorium) if the negotiations do not produce a result that guarantees the growth of the country," he added.
Baglini, an observer at <PLACE>Argentina</PLACE>'s negotiations in New York with the steering committee for its 320 creditors banks, told the Radio del Plata in a telephone interview that the banks were divided on the loan request.
He said <PLACE>Argentina</PLACE> was prepared to follow the example of Brazil, which last week declared a moratorium on interest payments of a large portion of its 108 billion dlr foreign debt.
<PLACE>Argentina</PLACE>'s prime objective in renegotiating the debt was to maintain growth, which has been targeted at four pct in 1987, Baglini said. "
Canadian Finance Minister <PERSON>Michael Wilson</PERSON> said he will use temporary authority under the Financial Administration act to borrow an additional 600 mln dlrs in next Thursday's treasury bill auction.
In a statement, <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> said the action would permit the government to proceed with its debt program during a period when there was not sufficient borrowing authority, which is granted by Parliament, to cover the government's needs.
Iran announced tonight that its major offensive against <PLACE>Iraq</PLACE> in the Gulf war had ended after dealing savage blows against the Baghdad government.
The Iranian news agency IRNA, in a report received in London, said the operation code-named Karbala-5 launched into <PLACE>Iraq</PLACE> on January 9 was now over.
It quoted a joint statewment by the Iranian Army and Revolutionary Guards Corps as saying that their forces had "dealt one of the severest blows on the Iraqi war machine in the history of the <PLACE>Iraq</PLACE>-imposed war."
The statement by the Iranian High Command appeared to herald the close of an assault on the port city of Basra in southern <PLACE>Iraq</PLACE>. "
It claimed massive victories in the seven-week offensive and called on supporters of Baghdad to "come to their senses" and discontinue support for what it called the tottering regime in <PLACE>Iraq</PLACE>.
<PLACE>Iran</PLACE> said its forces had "liberated" 155 square kilometers of enemy-occupied territory during the 1987 offensive and taken over islands, townships, rivers and part of a road leading into Basra.
<PLACE>Venezuela</PLACE> is seeking a 'constructive and flexible' attitude from its creditor banks in current talks to reschedule 21 billion dlrs in foreign debt, finance minister manuel azpurua told a press conference.
He declined to comment on meetings this week in new york between public finances director jorge marcano and <PLACE>Venezuela</PLACE>'s 13-bank advisory committee except to say, "they are progressing."
Azpurua said <PLACE>Venezuela</PLACE> has shown solidarity with brazil's decision to suspend payments, but each country must negotiate according to its own interest.
According to banking sources, the banks' latest offer to <PLACE>Venezuela</PLACE> is also a one pct margin as against the last february's 1-1/8 pct rescheduling accord and the 7/8 pct <PLACE>Venezuela </PLACE> wants.
He said <PLACE>Venezuela</PLACE>'s original proposal was to pay no principal on restructured debt this year, but is now insisting that if it makes payments they be compensated by new bank loans.
Nova, the Canadian company that owns 56 pct of Husky Oil Ltd, said it received government approval for a transaction under which &lt;Union Faith <PLACE>Canada</PLACE> Holding Ltd> would buy a 43 pct stake in Husky.
<PLACE>Brazil</PLACE>'s 14-bank advisory committee expressed "grave concern" to chief debt negotiator Antonio Padua de Seixas over the country's suspension of interest payments, according to a telex from committee chairman Citibank to creditor banks worldwide.
Bankers said the diplomatic phrase belied the deep anger and frustration on the committee over <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE>'s unilateral move last Friday and its subsequent freeze on some 15 billion dlrs of short-term trade and interbank lines.
Funaro will be explaining <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE>'s actions to U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker, Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker and International Monetary Fund managing director Michel Camdessus before travelling to Europe at the weekend.

Argentina has threatened to emulate <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE>'s payments moratorium if the banks do not grant its request.
Liquefied natural gas imports from <PLACE>Algeria</PLACE> are unlikely to happen in 1987 even though its economically feasible, U.S. industry analysts sources said.
Company sources currently in talks with <PLACE>Algeria</PLACE> agree, saying that Algerian LNG would only serve to meet peak demand.
Company sources also said that any negotiations with <PLACE>Algeria</PLACE> would emphasize looser arrangements which would relate volumes to market requirements and prices to U.S. spot market values.
The Tower Commission's scathing comments on President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s embattled chief of staff Donald Regan could signal the death knell to his White House tenure, but the impact of its strong criticism on two other top officials was less clear.
Regan has come in for tough criticism for his handling of <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s worst political crisis since details of the covert arms sales to Iran and diversion of profits to Nicaraguan rebels first emerged last November.
The report saved some of its most scathing language for Regan, a gruff former Wall Street executive and close personal friend of <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> whose autocratic rule in the White House angered some top <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> officials and, perhaps more importantly, <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s wife Nancy. "
Senate Republican leader Robert Dole, a key <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> ally, told reporters the report disclosed "colossal blunders" and said people who had not served the president well should step aside, but he did not specify who should go. "
Switzerland's economy, combining low unemployment, financial stability and a large external payments surplus, is in excellent condition and faces a satisfactory future, the <ORG>Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development</ORG>, OECD, said.
The OECD, in its annual report on <PLACE>Switzerland</PLACE>, picked out some signs of a slowdown in activity and a slight pick-up in inflation this year, but said these gave no cause for concern.
But "given <PLACE>Switzerland</PLACE>'s large external surplus, there should be no concern if domestic demand grows faster than GDP.
The grain companies are trying to get this fired up again," an aide to Agriculture Secretary <PERSON>Richard Lyng</PERSON> said. "
I just don't see any proposal like that sailing through any interagency process," the aide to <PERSON>Lyng</PERSON> said. "
But <PERSON>Lyng</PERSON>'s aide said that during a day-long visit to Capitol Hill yesterday, House members did not press the secretary on the subsidy question a single time.
The U.S. Treasury said it was willing to participate with several other industrial countries in providing a 500 mln-dlr short-term bridge loan to <PLACE>Argentina</PLACE>.
<PLACE>Argentina</PLACE> announced a wage and price freeze on Wednesday night and is negotiating with New York bankers for about 2.15
Our willingness to participate in this multilateral short-term financing indicates our support for <PLACE>Argentina</PLACE>'s economic program to achieve sustainable growth and a viable balance of payments position," the Treassury statement said.
But <PLACE>Argentina</PLACE> did not suspend interest payments on its foreign debts, as neighboring Brazil did last week.
The Treasury said the U.S. share of bridge financing for <PLACE>Argentina</PLACE> would come from its Exchange Stabilization Fund.
The one-page statement noted the International Monetary Fund expressed confidence in <PLACE>Argentina</PLACE>'s economic policies and prospects by approving a new stand-by financing arrangement for it on February 18. "
<PLACE>Argentina</PLACE> is expected to qualify for IMF balance-of-payments financing which would enable <PLACE>Argentina </PLACE> to repay a multilateral bridge loan and support the implementation of its economic program," the statement said.
Along with new financing, <PLACE>Argentina</PLACE> reportedly wants lower interest rates on an existing total 53 billion dlrs in foreign debt and elimination of foreign banks' control over how some of the money is loaned in <PLACE>Argentina </PLACE>.
(E.H. Industries ( <PLACE>Canada</PLACE>) Inc) said it plans to bid its EH101 helicopter to replace <PLACE>Canada </PLACE>'s fleet of Sea King aircraft.

Texaco <PLACE>Canada</PLACE> said it lowered the contract price it will pay for crude oil 64 Canadian cts a barrel, effective today.
Texaco <PLACE>Canada</PLACE> last changed its crude oil postings on Feb 19.
The numbers were a little disappointing, but I think we can take Mr <PERSON>Volcker</PERSON> at his word when he said that nothing had changed," said Bob Bannon of Security Pacific National Bank.
Fed Chairman <PERSON>Paul Volcker</PERSON> told a Congressional committee last Thursday that the Fed's policy "has been unchanged up to today."
Although <PERSON>Volcker</PERSON>'s statement last Thursday allayed most fears that the Fed had marginally tightened its grip on reserves to help an ailing dollar, many economists still wanted confirmation of a steady policy in today's data, which covered the two-week bank statement period ended yesterday.
<PLACE>Japan</PLACE> has pledged to try to increase its purchase of U.S. car parts and also to exchange data to monitor the purchases, the Commerce Department said.
<PLACE>Japan</PLACE> had agreed to try to increase purchases of U.S.-made parts by Japanese car makers and to begin long term contracts for parts purchases, a Commerce department official said.
He added that the agreement also said <PLACE>Japan</PLACE> agreed to try to devise a way to collect purchasing information in order to monitor progress in stepping up Japanese orders.
The Commerce Department said in a statement last year that "statistics support the perception in the United States that American auto parts suppliers are not welcome in the inner circles of <PLACE>Japan</PLACE>'s auto companies and their traditional suppliers."
It estimated that while <PLACE>Japan</PLACE>'s car firms sold almost five billion dlrs worth of parts in the United States in 1985, U.S. firms sold only one per cent of <PLACE>Japan </PLACE>'s 55 billion dlr market.
<PLACE>France</PLACE>'s right wing government is facing growing pressure to modify its economic policies after revising down its 1987 growth targets and revising up its inflation forecasts for this year.
And bank economists contacted by Reuters said they believed Prime Minister <PERSON>Jacques Chirac</PERSON> could be forced by slow growth and rising unemployment to reflate the economy later this year, perhaps in the autumn, to boost his prospects in Presidential elections due by April 1988. "
But the head of the socialist CFDT union federation, Edmond Maire, meeting with <PERSON>Chirac</PERSON> today, renewed union demands already rejected by the government for indexation clauses to be built into future pay contracts to safeguard workers against higher prices.
He announced after his meeting that Chirac had told him the government would spend two billion francs on a series of measures to boost employment and training Andre Bergeron, a widely respected leader of the moderate Force Ouvriere labour group, put similar demands to Chirac earlier in the week while the Communist-led CGT, the largest of <PLACE>France</PLACE>'s unions, declared the defence of its members earnings its top priority.
But with unemployment nearing 11 per cent last month, and still rising, government supporters and some economic analysts said they were confident <PERSON>Chirac</PERSON> could resist union pay demands. "
<PLACE>Japan</PLACE>'s unadjusted consumer price index (base 1985) fell 0.4
Leaders of <PLACE>Italy</PLACE>'s five coalition parties have agreed to meet today to try to settle their differences which are mainly between Prime Minister Bettino Craxi's Socialist Party and the majority Christian Democrats.
Monetary and credit growth rates in New Zealand are not expected to continue at current levels following the Reserve Bank's move to tighten liquidity late last year, Reserve Bank Governor <PERSON>Spencer Russell</PERSON> said.
The monetary and credit growth figures for the December quarter were probably artifically inflated by unusually high growth in inter-institutional lending activity on the short term money market, <PERSON>Russell</PERSON> said in a statement.
The bank moved to tighten liquidity when the initial signs of the recent expansion became apparent in September and October last year, <PERSON>Russell</PERSON> said.
Available evidence suggests that corporate customers, including non-bank financial institutions, have been exploiting differences between interest rates on overdrafts with trading banks and rates in the call market," <PERSON>Russell</PERSON> said.
pct the previous week, the Bank of <PLACE>Japan</PLACE> said.
Japanese life insurers, trust banks and corporations, largely responsible for vitalising the U.S. Bond market in recent years, are now eyeing stockmarkets in the U.S., Britain, <PLACE>France</PLACE> and Hong Kong, fund managers said.
<PLACE>Japan</PLACE>'s net buying in overseas stockmarkets this year may double or triple to 15-20 billion dlrs from seven billion in 1986, Shigeki Matsumoto of Nikko Securities Co Ltd, said.
Insurance companies have put the dominant portion of their funds into the U.S., But will now invest in Britain, West Germany, <PLACE>France</PLACE> and other countries, Hashimoto said.
Japanese investments in British equities have already turned active and the pace is likely to increase, said Andrew Sheaf, general manager of international equity activities at County Securities <PLACE>Japan</PLACE>. "
Deregulation in <PLACE>France</PLACE> is also attracting Japanese interest, but stock investments there will be inhibited by worries about the French franc, they said.
The combined assets of <PLACE>Taiwan</PLACE>'s offshore banking units (obu) rose to 6.28 billion U.S. Dlrs at end- January from 6.21
<PLACE>Japan</PLACE> is expected to cut the base lending rate for state financial institutions to 5.5 pct from 6.2
The base lending rate for state bodies such as the <PLACE>Japan</PLACE> Development Bank, People's Finance Corp and the finance corporations of local public enterprises usually moves in tandem with long-term prime rates, the sources said.
The move suggested it had reached agreement with depositors using the bureau, the postal savings system of the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry and the <PLACE>Japan</PLACE> welfare annuity of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the sources said.
<PLACE>Japan</PLACE>'s ruling and opposition parties agreed to reopen talks on the budget for the fiscal year ending March 31 1988 when the Lower House Budget Committee meets next Tuesday, a parliamentary official said.
Domestic demand is now expected to make no contribution to Australian economic growth in fiscal 1986/87, ending June 30, while net exports will account for all of the overall increase, Treasurer <PERSON>Paul Keating</PERSON> said here.
But <PERSON>Keating</PERSON> said domestic demand could fall slightly this financial year and net export growth will provide the total source of gdp growth.
<PERSON>Keating</PERSON> said the overall impact of the changed economic parameters is welcome as it appears to have contributed to a slightly more rapid correction in the current account deficit than first anticipated. "
Partial indicators released since the last meeting of EPAC in December indicate that the 1986/87 budget strategy is broadly on track, <PERSON>Keating</PERSON> said. "
<PERSON>Keating</PERSON> said it now seems likely that the 1986/87 inflation rate will exceed the budget forecast of eight pct. "
<PERSON>Keating</PERSON> said the government expects economic growth to pick up moderately in 1987/88 due to a further significant rise in net exports and a very moderate but positive contribution from private domestic demand.
The current account deficit will continue to show improvement in 1987/88," <PERSON>Keating</PERSON> said. "
<PLACE>Thailand</PLACE> exported 84,960 tonnes of rice in the week ended February 24, up from 80,498 the previous week, the Commerce Ministry said.

The <PLACE>Philippines</PLACE> will offer its commercial bank creditors an innovative pricing plan that will make debt payments through certificates of indebtedness as an alternative to cash, the authoritative Business Day newspaper said.
Finance Secretary <PERSON>Jaime Ongpin</PERSON> told reporters yesterday the alternative proposal is designed to avoid an impasse when debt rescheduling talks reopen in New York on Tuesday.
He did not give details but said, "It is a very useful alternative and in the end will permit the banks to say that they achieved their pricing target and will likewise permit the <PLACE>Philippines</PLACE> to say exactly the same thing."
The documents said peso proceeds can be invested in selected industries under the <PLACE>Philippines</PLACE>" debt/equity program.
<PERSON>Ongpin</PERSON> said Manila is sticking to its demand of a spread of 5/8 percentage points over London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR) for restructuring 3.6
(The proposal) will give the banks a choice of 5/8ths or the alternative," <PERSON>Ongpin</PERSON> said. "
"We don"t believe that there is going to be a problem on the accounting side," <PERSON>Ongpin</PERSON> said. "
A majority of Americans disapprove of the way <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON> has handled the presidency and one-third believe he should resign, a new poll said.
The poll conducted by Newsweek magazine said 53 pct of the respondents gave <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> a negative performance rating, nearly double his disapproval rating before the Iran/Contra scandal.
The magazine said, however, that <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> remained personally popular.
By better than a three-to-one ratio, a majority of those polled said they liked <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> on a personal level.
Their plan would perpetuate the status quo, allowing Brazil to retain almost all of its current 30 pct share of the export market, <PLACE>Colombia</PLACE> 17 pct, Ivory Coast seven pct and Indonesia six pct, with the rest divided among smaller exporters.
Their proposals would give Brazil a smaller quota share and <PLACE>Colombia</PLACE> and Indonesia a larger share, and bring a new quota distribution scheme into effect now rather than later.
<PLACE>Indonesia</PLACE>"s agriculture sector will grow by just 1.0
Production of <PLACE>Indonesia</PLACE>"s staple food, rice, is forecast to fall to around 26.3
mln tonnes in 1986, according to the annual report on <PLACE>Indonesia</PLACE>"s agricultural performance.

<PLACE>Kuwait</PLACE>"s Oil Minister, in remarks published today, said there were no plans for an emergency OPEC meeting to review oil policies after recent weakness in world oil prices.
He denied <PLACE>Kuwait</PLACE> was pumping above its quota of 948,000 barrels of crude daily (bpd) set under self-imposed production limits of the 13-nation organisation.
They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along with the much smaller producer <PLACE>Ecuador</PLACE>, among those producing above quota.
<PLACE>Kuwait</PLACE>, they said, was pumping 1.2
It is based on reports which said <PLACE>Kuwait</PLACE> has the ability to exceed its share.
They suppose that because <PLACE>Kuwait</PLACE> has the ability, it will do so," the minister said.
Sheikh Ali has said before that <PLACE>Kuwait</PLACE> had the ability to produce up to 4.0
If we can sell more than our quota at official prices, while some countries are suffering difficulties marketing their share, it means we in <PLACE>Kuwait</PLACE> are unusually clever," he said.
Sheikh Ali also delivered "a challenge to any international oil company that declared <PLACE>Kuwait</PLACE> sold below official prices."
However, <PLACE>Kuwait</PLACE> had guaranteed markets for its oil because of its local and international refining facilities and its own distribution network abroad, he added.
<PLACE>Ecuador</PLACE>"s deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite said last Wednesday his debt-burdened country wanted OPEC to assign a lower official price for its crude, and was to seek this at talks this month of opec"s pricing committee.
<PLACE>Indonesia</PLACE> appears to be nearing a political crossroads over measures to deregulate its protected economy, the U.S. Embassy says in a new report.
<PLACE>Indonesia</PLACE>, the only Asian member of OPEC and a leading primary commodity producer, has been severely hit by last year"s fall in world oil prices, which forced it to devalue its currency by 31 pct in September.
It primarily assesses <PLACE>Indonesia</PLACE>"s agricultural sector, but also reviews the country"s general economic performance.
Indonesia"s economic changes have been welcomed by the <ORG>World Bank</ORG> and international bankers as steps in the right direction, though they say crucial areas of the economy like plastics and steel remain highly protected, and virtual monopolies.
The report says <PLACE>Indonesia</PLACE>"s economic growth in calendar 1986 was probably about zero, and the economy may even have contracted a bit. "
<PLACE>Indonesia</PLACE>, the largest country in South-East Asia with a population of 168 million, is facing general elections in April.

More than 5 mln hectares of wheat-producing land in North <PLACE>China</PLACE> could be affected because relatively warm and dry weather had allowed bacteria and insect eggs to survive the winter, the agency added.

Poland's talks in Washington with the World Bank and the <ORG>International Monetary Fund</ORG> (IMF) on the country's 33.5
Wladyslaw Baka, head of <PLACE>Poland</PLACE>'s National Bank, told the official news agency PAP yesterday the talks were a step towards possible fresh credits or easier terms. "
Much attention was given to the Polish delegation and the talks at both institutions involved displayed a lot of understanding for <PLACE>Poland</PLACE>'s difficult economic position," PAP quoted Baka as saying.

Indonesia is unlikely to import copra from the <PLACE>Philippines</PLACE> in 1987 after importing 30,000 tonnes in 1986, the U.S. Embassy's annual agriculture report said.
The report said the 31 pct devaluation of the Indonesian rupiah, an increase in import duties on copra and increases in the price of <PLACE>Philippines</PLACE> copra have reduced the margin between prices in the two countries.

Philippine Finance Secretary <PERSON>Jaime Ongpin</PERSON> starts negotiations with the country's 12-bank advisory committee in New York tomorrow, buoyed by an economy on the mend and political stability one year after President Corazon Aquino took power, central bank officials said.
Chile's 15-1/2 year rescheduling accord at one percentage point over London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR) and Venezuala's 21 billion dlr package at 7/8 point over LIBOR portend well for the <PLACE>Philippines</PLACE>, despite Brazil's repayment suspension last week, the officials said.
<PERSON>Ongpin</PERSON> wants 5/8 point over the benchmark rate, which is currently hovering around 6-1/2 pct.
The banks are said to be firm on the 1-1/8 points offered when the last round of negotiations collapsed on November 7. <PERSON>Ongpin</PERSON> said every 1/16 point over LIBOR meant an additional 5.1

The Stock Exchange of <PLACE>Singapore</PLACE> (SES) plans to introduce electronic trading of shares listed on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System (NASDAQ) in the U.S. And on London's Stock Exchange Automated Quotation System, banking sources said.
Monetary Authority of <PLACE>Singapore</PLACE> (MAS) sources told Reuters they supported the proposed linking of computer trading systems on the three exchanges, and the banking sources said local financial support for the plan existed.
Macklin said if an agreement were reached it would move the three exchanges towards 24-hour trading, with <PLACE>Singapore</PLACE> filling a gap when no trading takes place.
The <PLACE>Singapore</PLACE>, London and New York authorities have agreed in principle on how the three exchanges would trade and transfer information among the different time zones, but some details still have to be worked out, a senior <PLACE>Singapore </PLACE> bank director said.
Questions remain concerning investor willingness to deploy sufficient capital in <PLACE>Singapore</PLACE> to ensure adequate market liquidity and communication links to the other three centres.
But if agreement is reached, <PLACE>Singapore</PLACE> will have a head start over the other Asian financial centres in Hong Kong, Toyko and Australia, he said.
On February 18 the SES created the Stock Exchange of <PLACE>Singapore</PLACE> Dealing and Automated Quotation System (SESDAQ), modelled on NASDAQ.
At present SESDAQ is trading the shares of only one company, the government-owned <PLACE>Singapore</PLACE> National Printers Ltd (SNP), but its turnover has been fairly active, and other small firms have said they plan to seek listings soon.

<PLACE>Iraq</PLACE> has secured agreement to defer outstanding payments on a 500 mln dlr syndicated euroloan following five months of negotiations with creditor banks.
Banking sources said the rescheduling is part of <PLACE>Iraq</PLACE>'s continuing effort to defer payments of foreign debt as its economy comes under strain from the Gulf War and soft world oil prices.

It said <PLACE>Indonesia</PLACE> did not achieve its goal of self-sufficiency in soybean output in calendar 1986 because it did not meet a planned increase in area planted and because yields have remained below target.

We're not very enthusiastic about <PLACE>Nigeria</PLACE>'s debt rescheduling," said a senior official at a leading Japanese bank.
A team of Nigerian officials will meet with Japanese creditor banks here later this week to seek Japanese support for a proposed refinancing of part of <PLACE>Nigeria</PLACE>'s 19 billion dlr foreign debt, bankers said.
The senior bank official said a majority of Japanese bank creditors are unwilling to provide any new credits to <PLACE>Nigeria</PLACE> although about 80 pct have reluctantly agreed to accept rescheduling of part of their existing loans. "
The problem is <PLACE>Nigeria</PLACE> has so far neglected us Japanese creditors and we have yet to receive a clear-cut picture of the nation's debt situation," said another Japanese bank official.
He said Japanese bankers were unaware of the exact extent of Western commercial bank exposure to <PLACE>Nigeria</PLACE> and were uncertain about the proposed refinancing package details.
Some 21 Japanese banks have loans outstanding to <PLACE>Nigeria</PLACE>, representing about four pct of the credit extended by Western commercial institutions, banking sources said.

Prime Minister <PERSON>Yasuhiro Nakasone</PERSON> is likely to leave office this summer amid opposition to his controversial tax-reform package, political analysts said.
They said <PERSON>Nakasone</PERSON>'s reputation as a skilled politician has suffered irreparable damage from his support of a five pct sales tax planned for January 1988. "
<PERSON>Nakasone</PERSON> is trying to carry out a drastic tax reform at the end of his administration, which is not only impossible but also is very irresponsible as a politican," Rei Shiratori, professor of politics at Dokkyo University, told Reuters. "
<PERSON>Nakasone</PERSON> will almost certainly step down as soon as parliament approves the sales tax, probably in the summer," Shiratori said.
Some ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) members of parliament have spoken against the tax, which <PERSON>Nakasone</PERSON> says is needed to balance planned cuts in income and corporate taxes.
<PERSON>Nakasone</PERSON> today called for disciplinary action against LDP members who oppose the tax. "
"A proposed sales tax has become a political issue, partly because <PERSON>Nakasone</PERSON> breached his election pledge against introducing it," Shiratori said. "
To lure opposition parties back to parliament after the LDP pushes through the tax bills, the <PERSON>Nakasone</PERSON> cabinet will have to resign, Sato said. "
<PLACE>Thailand</PLACE>'s Commerce Ministry announced a new tapioca export quota of 737,987 tonnes for the European Community against 762,860 tonnes for the previous allocation.

Mine and industry officials from most member states of the <ORG>Association of Tin Producing Countries</ORG> (ATPC) say they have found ways to limit group exports to 96,000 tonnes in the year started March 1, according to views polled by Reuter correspondents.
Under the ATPC plan, Malaysia has been allocated an export quota of 28,526 tonnes, <PLACE>Indonesia</PLACE> 24,516, Thailand 19,000, Bolivia 13,761, Zaire 1,736 and Nigeria 1,461.
<PLACE>Australia</PLACE> has said it is not setting any export quota.
Comment from officials in <PLACE>Zaire</PLACE> was unavailable.
Mine officials in <PLACE>Malaysia</PLACE>, the world's leading producer, said only 188 mines will be allowed to operate to ensure that output is limited to around 31,500 tonnes in the year started March 1. Chief Inspector of Mines Redzuan Sumun told Reuters that excess output of some 3,000 tonnes after exports of 28,500 in the one-year quota period would be kept in the national stock.
Mine owners in <PLACE>Malaysia</PLACE> have welcomed the ATPC export curb and asked the government not to issue new mining licences.
ATPC chairman and <PLACE>Indonesia</PLACE>'s Mining and Energy Minister Subroto has pledged his country's support for the export curb.
A spokesman for the state-owned tin mining company PT Tambang Timah told Reuters it would be easy for <PLACE>Indonesia</PLACE> to stick to an export quota of 24,516 tonnes because this was close to exports in calendar 1986 of 24,636.
In Bangkok, Thai Industry Minister Pramual Sabhavasu said <PLACE>Thailand</PLACE> would keep to its 19,000 tonne quota and added this would not cause the local industry hardship at current prices.
To insure adherence, the industry ministry and sole tin exporter <PLACE>Thailand</PLACE> Smelting and Refining Co would encourage bigger stockpiles, and income tax exemptions would be permitted, he said.
<PLACE>Thailand</PLACE> exported 18,367 tonnes in 1986, up from 17,359 in 1985, Pramual said.
<PLACE>Bolivia</PLACE> said it expects to export less tin this year than its allocated 13,761 tonne quota.
Mining Minister Jaimie Villalobos told Reuters in La Paz that <PLACE>Bolivia</PLACE> expected to export about 9,000 tonnes of tin in calendar 1987.
He said this was due to the sacking after the tin crisis of October 1985 of about 20,000 of the 28,000 workers at the state mining company Comibol, which produces more than 80 pct of <PLACE>Bolivia</PLACE>'s total exports.
Mines, Power and Steel Minister Bunu Sheriff Musa said in Lagos that <PLACE>Nigeria</PLACE> would have no difficulty keeping within its ATPC quota of 1,461 tonnes because its metals output had declined due to poor demand and high production costs.
Industry sources told Reuters that <PLACE>Nigeria</PLACE>'s output was less than 1,000 tonnes last year.
Non-members <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE> and China have pledged to cooperate with the ATPC and limit their exports to 21,000 and 7,000 tonnes respectively during the quota period.

Prime Minister <PERSON>Rajiv Gandhi</PERSON>'s fiscal 1987/88 budget has sparked speculation that a large deficit will push up India's moderate inflation rate and that the country's stock markets will experience prolonged uncertainty, economists, politicians and stockbrokers told Reuters.
Presenting the budget to parliament on Saturday, Prime Minister <PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON> said a cabinet committee would be appointed to trim large non-development expenditures.
But few analysts have taken <PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON>'s assurance seriously.
Lal Krishna Advani, president of the opposition Bharatiya Janata party, said <PERSON>Gandhi</PERSON>'s failure to mention specific measures to cut non-development expenses will push up prices.
Avinash Purulkar, chief manager of the state-owned Union Bank of <PLACE>India</PLACE>, said the annual inflation rate may double to around 15 pct in 1987/88 as the government prints more currency notes to cover the deficit.

The company's foreign debt, mainly from the Japanese and U.S. Banks, was cut nearly by half to 66.2 billion <PLACE>Taiwan</PLACE> dlrs equivalent in calendar 1986 from 124.6
Its domestic borrowings however rose to 105.2 billion <PLACE>Taiwan</PLACE> dlrs from 80.6

<PLACE>Hungary</PLACE> is to embark on a new series of austerity measures to tackle a budget deficit which tripled last year after quadrupling in 1985.
Asked if these measures were being taken under pressure from the <ORG>International Monetary Fund</ORG> (IMF), Boesze said: "
Boesze said preliminary figures showed that <PLACE>Hungary</PLACE>'s state budget deficit rose to a preliminary 47 billion forints last year from 15.8

<PLACE>Italy</PLACE>'s strong economic revival has led some observers to talk of miracles and created euphoria in some quarters about future growth prospects, but many Italian experts warn that the current wave of optimism is excessive. "
..Foreign observers always oscillate in the case of <PLACE>Italy</PLACE> between complete pessimism and unwarranted optimism," says Luigi Spaventa, one of <PLACE>Italy </PLACE>'s leading economists and a professor at Rome University.
According to Spaventa, these violent swings of mood have been occurring for the last 15 years, with <PLACE>Italy</PLACE> one minute seen as the "bad boy of Europe" and unable to raise a dollar and the next a worker of miracles and basking in admiration, "I think there's a lot of exaggeration.
..Once it used to be the underground economy and all the correspondents of foreign newspapers flocked to <PLACE>Italy</PLACE> to study this.
Spaventa, in tune with other economists and industrialists here, stress <PLACE>Italy</PLACE>'s recent achievements, particularly the dramatic and solid recovery in the fortunes of industrial enterprises, but warns that the economy is still vulnerable.
Expectations by some experts that <PLACE>Italy</PLACE> is poised to replace Britain as the world's fifth largest economy have also boosted optimism.
<PLACE>Italy</PLACE> itself has made it clear it is not happy with what it feels to be its second-rate status among the major industrialised countries.
<PLACE>Italy</PLACE> said its exclusion from the meeting violated an agreement reached in Tokyo last year to let <PLACE>Italy </PLACE> and Canada attend meetings held by the five whenever discussions concerned managing the international monetary system.
But <PLACE>Italy</PLACE> needs first to tackle some fundamental problems still facing its economy, economists and industrialists say. "
He says that while <PLACE>Italy</PLACE>'s recent achievements are indeed cause for satisfaction and optimism, the focus now should be on the problems still remaining rather than those already solved.
Another problem is <PLACE>Italy</PLACE>'s reliance on imported raw materials.
This factor actually worked sharply in <PLACE>Italy</PLACE>'s favour last year, when lower energy costs helped slash the country's trade deficit to 3,717 billion lire by year end from 23,085 billion lire in 1985.
If <PLACE>Italy</PLACE> truly wants to be counted among the world's top industrialised nations, it also needs to tighten up stockmarket operating procedures and encourage firms to supply more quality information about their activities, economists say.
<PLACE>Italy</PLACE> has no controls on insider trading.
<PLACE>Japan</PLACE> and the U.S. Kick off top-level trade talks tomorrow amid signs officials from both sides are growing increasingly irritated with each other.

Faced with growing Congressional protectionist pressure, the U.S. Administration is pressing <PLACE>Japan</PLACE> for speedy action to reduce its still huge trade surplus, U.S. Officials said. "
The official said the 40 pct rise of the yen over the last 18 months has hit <PLACE>Japan</PLACE> hard, forcing exporters to slash spending and lay off workers to make up for lost sales abroad.
The talks begin tomorrow with high-level discussions on the economic structures of both countries and how they affect the bilateral trade imbalance, which last year amounted to 51.48 billion dlrs in <PLACE>Japan</PLACE>'s favour.
On the following two days, the topics will range from multilateral trade talks under the auspices of the <ORG>General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade</ORG> (GATT) to such bilateral trade problems as super computers.
Some U.S. Officials complained <PLACE>Japan</PLACE> has no intention of boosting domestic demand and imports, as Washington wants.
<PLACE>Japan</PLACE> seems particularly peeved at being singled in a draft trade bill before the Senate as a nation following adverserial trade practices. "
It condemns <PLACE>Japan</PLACE> without due process," one Japanese official said.
<PLACE>Japan</PLACE> is also not totally happy with the administration's trade bill, particularly its proposal to establish reciprocal access to foreign markets as one criteria for retaliatory trade action by the U.S., Officials said.

The <PLACE>Philippines</PLACE> will offer commercial bank creditors an innovative pricing plan that will make debt payments through certificates of indebtedness instead of cash, the authoritative Business Day newspaper said.
Finance Secretary <PERSON>Jaime Ongpin</PERSON> told reporters Saturday that the alternative proposal is designed to avoid an impasse when debt rescheduling talks reopen in New York on Tuesday.
He did not give details but said, "It is a very useful alternative and in the end will permit the banks to say that they achieved their pricing target and will likewise permit the <PLACE>Philippines</PLACE> to say exactly the same thing."
The peso proceeds can be invested in selected industries under the <PLACE>Philippines</PLACE>' debt/equity program.
<PERSON>Ongpin</PERSON> said Manila is sticking to its demand of a spread of 5/8 percentage points over London interbank offered Rates (LIBOR) for restructuring 3.6
(The proposal) will give the banks a choice of 5/8ths or the alternative," <PERSON>Ongpin</PERSON> said. "
"We don't believe that there is going to be a problem on the accounting side," <PERSON>Ongpin</PERSON> said. "
<PLACE>Argentina</PLACE>'s chief debt negotiator said he was confident of a prompt accord with international creditor banks for rescheduling the country's foreign debt. "
I'm quite optimistic about carrying out a serious and quick negotiation," Treasury Secretary <PERSON>Mario Brodersohn</PERSON> said on return from talks in New York with leading U.S. and world financial officials.
<PLACE>Argentina</PLACE> is currently negotiating terms with the steering committee for its creditor banks that will allow it to meet four pct economic growth targets in 1987.

<PERSON>Ongpin</PERSON> acknowledged there was a dispute over tactics. "
she said, adding <PERSON>Ongpin</PERSON>'s stand was not good for the economy. "
It ( <PERSON>Ongpin</PERSON>'s stand) is going to make it much more difficult for the economy to attain its growth targets," Monsod said. "
She said if the banks refused to lend the new money, the <PLACE>Philippines</PLACE> should copy Brazil's action last week in freezing all debt repayments. "
<PLACE>Japan</PLACE> appears resolved to encourage domestic demand for its goods instead of relying on exports to support its economy, Jean-Claude Paye, Director General of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), told a news conference.
Paye has been in <PLACE>Japan</PLACE> exchanging views on problems confronting the world economy and the role of the OECD.
He met with Prime Minister <PERSON>Yasuhiro Nakasone</PERSON>, Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari, Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita and other high-ranking Japanese officials.
<PLACE>Kuwait</PLACE>'s oil minister said in a newspaper interview that there were no plans for an emergency OPEC meeting after the recent weakness in world oil prices.
He also denied that <PLACE>Kuwait</PLACE> was pumping above its OPEC quota of 948,000 barrels of crude daily (bpd). Crude oil prices fell sharply last week as international oil traders and analysts estimated the 13-nation OPEC was pumping up to one million bpd over its self-imposed limits.
<PLACE>Taiwan</PLACE> plans another round of deep tariff cuts this year to help narrow its trade surplus with the U.S., A senior economic planner said.
Wang Chao-Ming, vice-chairman of the council for economic planning and development, told Reuters <PLACE>Taiwan</PLACE> would further reduce import tariffs on 1,700 products sometime in the second half of this year.
The United States, <PLACE>Taiwan</PLACE>'s main trading partner, has said the island's import tariffs, still ranging from a high of almost 60 pct, were unacceptable.
<PLACE>Taiwan</PLACE>'s trade surplus with the United States hit 13.6
The surplus has boosted foreign exchange reserves to 50 billion dlrs, which Wang said made <PLACE>Taiwan</PLACE> a target for U.S. Protectionism.
Wang said the trade surplus and the reserves weakened <PLACE>Taiwan</PLACE>'s position in talks with Washington over export quotas, particularly for shoes, textiles and machine tools which are among the island's main export-earners.
A special Taiwanese trade delegation leaves for Washington tomorrow to try to renegotiate an agreement signed last year limiting exports of <PLACE>Taiwan</PLACE> textiles.
Under the accord, <PLACE>Taiwan</PLACE>'s textile export growth was limited to 0.5 pct each year until 1988.

<PERSON>Balladur</PERSON> said the upward revision of the inflation target, which the government had initially set at two pct for this year, should not affect wage expectations for this year. "
<PLACE>Brazil</PLACE> would not have suspended payments on debt owed to foreign banks if it had received more and faster financing from official lending agencies, Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said.
He said he would not seek more money from the <ORG>International Monetary Fund</ORG> to which Brazil paid 922 mln dlrs last year and said Brazil's problems could not be solved by IMF intervention. "
Asked if <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE> would have continued making payments of monthly interest to its foreign commercial bank lenders if official lending agencies had provided more funds, he replied, "Yes, because our country did not receive financing from these agencies."
<PLACE>Brazil</PLACE>, with foreign debt totaling 108 billion dlrs, stunned the banking community last week by suspending payments on some 68 billion dlrs owed to private banks.
Funaro said <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE> had paid 44 billion dollars to the World Bank and other lending agencies and commercial banks in the past four years and got only 11 billion dlrs in loans.
Some mechanism has to be found to finance a country like <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE>," Funaro said.
He did not specify what steps he had in mind but said he would like to see "automatic" official lending when needed so that <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE> would not have to dip into its dwindling reserves, now reported to be below four billion dlrs.
Funaro said <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE> had the world's third-largest trade surplus and estimated the 1987 surplus would be at least eight billion dlrs.

After a week that left his presidency shaken and his popularity at a new low, <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON> and his new chief of staff today begin trying to revive an administration tattered by the Iran-contra arms scandal.
Reagan and former Senate Republican leader <PERSON>Howard Baker</PERSON>, whose appointment as White House chief of staff won bipartisan praise, will begin mapping strategy to deal with scathing criticism by a report on his failed bid to trade U.S. arms with Iran for help in freeing Ameican hostages in Lebanon.
Among the chores facing <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s new inner circle is assessing the damage the 300-page Tower commission report has done to the nomination of Robert Gates to succeed William Casey as the new head of the Central Intelligence Agency.
Aides said that Gates' future would be given high priority by <PERSON>Baker</PERSON>.
He has the smell of <PLACE>Iran</PLACE> on him," said former Nevada Sen.
and <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> confidant Paul Laxalt. "
Regan, the former Wall Street executive and Treasury secretary who has been the president's top aide for the past two years, was assigned the lion's share of the blame for the botched handling of the <PLACE>Iran</PLACE> arms sale.
The report blamed Regan for the "chaos that descended on the White House" since it was first revealed last November that profits from the <PLACE>Iran</PLACE> arms sales had been diverted to contra rebels fighting the leftist Nicaraguan government.
Oliver North who was fired after it was disclosed last November 23 that profits from the <PLACE>Iran</PLACE> arms sale were diverted to the contras.
The two, pictured by the Tower commission as the key operators of the <PLACE>Iran</PLACE> arms deal, have refused to testify.
<PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>, who freely admits disliking details, is portrayed in the Tower report as a befuddled chief executive whose inattention let his aides run away with his foreign policy.
That perception has wrecked <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s popularity and threatened to condemn him to lame duck status until he leaves office in January 1989.
A recent Newsweek magazine poll found that just 40 pct of Americans approved of <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s leadership, a record low, and a third believed he should consider resignation.
John Tower, <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> is now preparing for a nationwide television address this week to respond to the criticisms of his presidency.

A <PLACE>Taiwan</PLACE> mission will leave next week for Washington to renegotiate an agreement severely limiting the growth of the island's textile exports, a Board of Foreign Trade official said.
Under the agreement signed last July, <PLACE>Taiwan</PLACE>'s textile export growth was limited to 0.5 pct each year until 1988, based on the value of 1985 exports.
He said <PLACE>Taiwan</PLACE> now found it difficult to compete with its two main rivals and the problem had been made worse because of the surging value of the <PLACE>Taiwan </PLACE> dollar.
World animal health experts called for a campaign to eradicate the lethal cattle disease Rinderpest in <PLACE>Bangladesh</PLACE>, Bhutan, India, Nepal and Pakistan, a statement from a Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) meeting here said.

U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON>Nigel Lawson</PERSON> has told Brazil's Finance Minister Dilson Funaro that negotiations on Brazil's debt to commercial banks are a matter for the commercial banks themselves, a Treasury spokesman said.
He added an accord with the <ORG>International Monetary Fund</ORG> (IMF) could be a very helpful support.
<PLACE>Brazil</PLACE> on February 20 suspended interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of its debts to commercial banks.
<PERSON>Lawson</PERSON>'s attitude was interpreted by banking sources as a clear rebuff to Brazilian hopes of obtaining official cooperation in resolving its external debt crisis.
Funaro, accompanied by central bank president Francisco Gros, is on the first leg of a tour of European capitals in an attempt to explain to governments <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE>'s indefinite suspension of interest payments earlier this month.
<PLACE>Brazil</PLACE> has in the past rejected a substantial role for the IMF in managing its economy, arguing that an IMF austerity program by promoting exports and dampening domestic consumption would lead to recession and threaten democracy.
Funaro said on Saturday in Washington that <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE> would not have suspended payment on its debt if it had received more and faster financing from international agencies.
He said earlier today that <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE> was first approaching governments before talking to the commercial banks themselves about the interest payment moratorium "because the banks have some limits.
Funaro said on Friday that his talks with U.S. Officials had resulted in no new financial arrangement to help resolve <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE>'s debt crisis, describing the meeting as an initial contact.
He had earlier met Federal Reserve Board Chairman <PERSON>Paul Volcker</PERSON> and U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker.
After travelling this week to France, Germany, <PLACE>Switzerland</PLACE> and Italy, Funaro hopes to visit Canada and Japan next week before starting negotiations with banks.

The latest requests for the maize were for export to <PLACE>Switzerland</PLACE>, Austria and Lichtenstein at a maximum daily rebate prefixed last Friday at 141 Ecus a tonne against a previous 20 Ecu daily rebate.
The special daily rebate for maize was set in the context of a Commission commitment to grant this season rebates for the export of 500,000 tonnes of French maize to non-EC countries, in compensation for concessions to the U.S. in the recent dispute over grain sales to <PLACE>Spain</PLACE>.
Requests for barley were for export to <PLACE>Switzerland</PLACE>, Austria and Lichtenstein, Ceuta and Melilla at an unchanged pre-fixed restitution of 125 Ecus a tonne, while requests for soft wheat flour were for export to various non-EC countries at an unchanged 178 Ecus a tonne.
The Canadian government is expected to announce later this week its final ruling whether U.S. corn exports to <PLACE>Canada</PLACE> have injured Ontario corn growers, U.S. government and farm group representatives said.
In that case, <PLACE>Canada</PLACE> decided pasta imports, which take about ten pct of the Canadian market, did not injure domestic producers.
<PLACE>Canada</PLACE> slapped a 1.05 dlrs per bushel duty on U.S. corn imports in November 1986, but reduced the duty to 85 cts last month because the Canadian government said U.S. subsidies to corn producers were less than <PLACE>Canada </PLACE> earlier estimated.

<PLACE>Cuba</PLACE> has told international sugar operators who have bought its sugar for shipment in March that these contracts will take second place to <PLACE>Cuba </PLACE>'s direct shipments to its export markets, dealers here said.
Some traders who have received telexes from <PLACE>Cuba</PLACE> said the language of the message was not totally clear and some believed shipments would be honoured if the traders declare the Soviet Union as the destination of their contracts.
The telexes have fueled rising world prices in the last week and reflect a poor Cuban crop, worry over <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE>'s export availability, and increasing Soviet demand, analysts said.
Traders said signs of Cuba's shortage of immediately available raw sugar to supply its traditional martkets was probably the factor behind <PLACE>Syria</PLACE> calling a snap buying tender last month.
Normally <PLACE>Syria</PLACE> calls white sugar buying tenders for forward delivery, and last month's spot requirement resulted in the sale of several cargoes.
<PLACE>Cuba</PLACE> in its telex told operators they would not receive March shipments as <PLACE>Cuba </PLACE> has to meet its contracts to export markets, traders said.

<PLACE>Canada</PLACE>'s decision to raise the issue of a free trade pact with the U.S. was a sign of what many see as a new spirit of Canadian self-confidence, a public policy study group said "It suggests the <PLACE>Canada </PLACE> of the immediate post-war period, when it was a major player in the process of building a postwar world," the Washington-based Atlantic Council said.
The council said that in the talks, <PLACE>Canada</PLACE> is chiefly interested in minimizing the imposing of U.S. duties against allegedly subsidized exports.
She said the decision to close the office was made as a result of changes in Chemical's regional customer base and to improve efficiency by centralizing the bank's Gulf activities in <PLACE>Bahrain</PLACE>.

Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro flatly rejected a U.K. Suggestion that his country seek <ORG>International Monetary Fund</ORG> help in order to facilitate debt negotiations with commercial creditor banks.
Talking to reporters, Funaro said this attitude would not help resolve the crisis started when <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE> suspended indefenitely interest payments on 68 billion dlrs in external debt on February 20.
Talking before his departure for Paris, he said there could be no question of <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE> adopting another IMF austerity plan after a similar package four years ago "put <PLACE>Brazil </PLACE> in a very big recession."
Funaro was reactnng to a British statement following his talks with Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON>Nigel Lawson</PERSON>, saying the U.K. Government had no part to play in what it viewed as a problem between Brazil and its commercial creditor banks.
Britain also believed an IMF program would help along negotiations between <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE> and the commercial banks, the statement, which banking sources interpreted as an outright rebuttal of all Brazilian demands, said. "
He said Lawson had made no commitments to support <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE>'s efforts.
<PERSON>Lawson</PERSON> would officially state his position when the two meet again next month for the IMF and World Bank spring meetings in Washington, Funaro said.
Stressing there was no binding time schedule for <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE>'s debt problem to be resolved, Funaro said <PLACE>Brazil </PLACE> had not come to Europe with specific proposals to overcome the present crisis. "
Neither did <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE> plan a major overhaul of current domestic economic policies, which Funaro said would likely lead to a five pct economic growth this year. "
The recent Australian proposals were a good starting point for discussions, "but we do not want the Australians to feel they are alone in developing an agenda for discussions" on world grain trade, the president of the National Association of Wheat Growers, NAWG, and the chairman of U.S. Wheat Associates said in a letter to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and U.S. Trade Representative <PERSON>Clayton Yeutter</PERSON>.
<PLACE>Australia</PLACE>'s proposals, which aim to reduce U.S. target prices and "quarantine" U.S. wheat stocks, would continue to place the burden of supply adjustment and reform on U.S. farmers, they said.
Other countries, including <PLACE>Australia</PLACE>, have benefitted from the higher world prices that have resulted from past U.S. acreage and crop reduction programs, the organizations said. "
Westinghouse Electric Corp said it agreed in principle to form a joint venture in factory automation with Matsushita Electric Industrial Co Ltd of <PLACE>Japan</PLACE>.
President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) <PERSON>Jorio Dauster</PERSON> told Reuters after the contact group meeting there had been no agreement on quotas as consumers had tried to dictate market shares rather than negotiate them.
<PERSON>Dauster</PERSON> said there are no plans yet to renew negotiations at a later date.
<PLACE>Brazil</PLACE> is not happy with the existing structure of the 14-bank advisory committee which coordinates its commercial bank debt, Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said.
U.S. Banks have 50 pct representation on the committee while holding only 35 pct of <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE>'s debt to banks, he said, adding "This is not fair with the European and Japanese banks."
Noting the often different reactions of U.S., Japanese and European banks, Funaro told journalists that <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE> might adopt an approach involving separate discussions with the regions.
<PLACE>Brazil</PLACE> on February 20 suspended indefinitely interest payments on 68 billion dlrs owed to commercial banks, followed last week by a freeze on bank and trade credit lines deposited by foreign banks and institutions, worth some 15 billion dlrs.
Funaro and Gros spent two days at the end of last week in Washington talking to government officials and international agencies and will this week visit Britain, France, West Germany, <PLACE>Switzerland</PLACE> and Italy for discussions with governments.
Funaro and Gros are today meeting British Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON>Nigel Lawson</PERSON>, Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe and Governor of the Bank of England Robin Leigh-Pemberton.
Bankers have estimated that <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE> owes U.K. Banks around 8.5
billion dlrs in long and medium term loans, giving the U.K. The third largest exposure after the U.S. And <PLACE>Japan</PLACE>.
The crisis began when <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE>'s trade surplus, its chief means of servicing its foreign debt, started to decline sharply and the problem was compounded by a renewed surge in the country'rate of inflation.
Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro flatly rejected a U.K. Suggestion that his country seek <ORG>International Monetary Fund</ORG> (IMF) help in order to facilitate debt negotiations with commercial creditor banks.

Baker told a brief news conference "I expect you'll see the president very soon" when asked by reporters when <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> expected to resume his news conferences.
<PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> has not met the press since November 19.
Baker said <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> had intended to conduct today's news conference and only the lack of a firm announcement of a replacement for Robert Gates as CIA director prevented him.

U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter today said that if the <ORG>European Community</ORG>'s Council of Ministers approves a tax on vegetable oils and fats, another major transatlantic trade row will erupt over agriculture.
In a statement issued by the trade representative's office following a speech to the American Soybean Association's board of directors, <PERSON>Yeutter</PERSON> said the proposed tax would have a severe impact on American soybean farmers, who export some 2.4
This is an unacceptable situation for us and its (vegetable oils tax) enactment would leave us no choice but to vigorously protect our trade rights and defend our access to the European market," <PERSON>Yeutter</PERSON> said.
<PERSON>Yeutter</PERSON> said the proposed vegetable oils tax would violate EC obligations under the GATT.
I am astonished that the EC commission would propose such a provocative measure so soon after we successfully resolved the agricultural dispute over the enlargement of the EC to include Spain and <PLACE>Portugal</PLACE>," Yeutter said. "
Greece, responding to a warning by <PLACE>Turkey</PLACE> against conducting oil activities in the Aegean Sea, said today it had the right to decide where and how to do research or drilling work in the area.
A government spokesman said the Greek position was made clear to <PLACE>Turkey</PLACE>'s ambassador Nazmi Akiman when he met Greek Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Yannis Kapsis last week.
The Greek statement today said, " <PLACE>Greece</PLACE> is not prepared to give up even a trace of its sovereignty rights to the seabed.
"The Greek government has repeatedly let the Turkish side know that it considers the 1976 Berne protocol as inactive through the fault of <PLACE>Turkey</PLACE>," it said.

French industry is failing to produce the goods its markets need and its loss of competitiveness has left the government little room for manoeuvre to reflate the economy, the <ORG>Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development</ORG> said.
" <PLACE>France</PLACE>'s poor export performance reflects a geographical bias in favour of markets less dynamic than the average.
With French unit productivity costs now among the lowest in the OECD area, the inflation differential between <PLACE>France</PLACE> and its main trading rival, West Germany, could fall to just one pct this year, it said.
Last week's White House shake-up has increased the odds that Federal Reserve Board chairman <PERSON>Paul Volcker</PERSON>, a symbol of strength in a government reeling from the arms-to-Iran scandal, will serve a third term, sources close to the Fed say.
But they said that no decision on the appointment, which must be filled this August, has been taken by the White House and <PERSON>Volcker</PERSON> too has not made up his mind.
Former White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan, who resigned last week when ex-senator <PERSON>Howard Baker</PERSON> was named as his replacement, was implacably opposed to Volcker and tried often to undermine him.
It is an open secret in Washington that Regan tried to ensure that <PERSON>Volcker</PERSON>, first appointed in 1979 by President Carter, will not be offered a third term by President Reagan.
Only Volcker's key allies in the Reagan administration, Vice-President George Bush and Treasury Secretary <PERSON>James Baker</PERSON>, kept Regan's recent maneuvering at bay, the sources said.
Sources close to the administration say Regan leaked a story, quickly shot down by others in the administration, that <PERSON>Beryl Sprinkel</PERSON>, chairman of the council of economic advisers, had been chosen to replace Volcker.
The sources said New White House Chief of Staff <PERSON>Howard Baker</PERSON> has a very good relationship with his namesake at the Treasury Department and is likely to respect his views on the Fed chairmanship.
As a moderate Republican, Baker is also unlikely to share the right-wing's opposition to <PERSON>Volcker</PERSON>. "
This new White House is going to need all the strength it can get," said one source when asked about the possibility of <PERSON>Volcker</PERSON>'s reappointment.
<PERSON>Paul Volcker</PERSON> is deeply respected in financial markets both in the United States and around the world.
At a time when the stability of the dollar and the viability of major debtor nations are in question, <PERSON>Volcker</PERSON>'s departure would definitely undermine U.S. leadership, foreign exchange analysts say.
U.S. officials say <PERSON>Volcker</PERSON> works very closely with Treasury Secretary Baker on issues like international debt and global economic cooperation.
The two men seem only to differ on how far to deregulate the banking industry, but recent statements by <PERSON>Volcker</PERSON>, in which he adopted a more liberal attitude on deregulation, signalled the politically-independent central bank is coming around at least partially to the Treasury position.
And a recent statement by a <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> administration official that the two men saw "exactly eye-to-eye" on the dollar was seen as an indication of Baker's support for the Fed chairman.
Baker is understood to have played a key role in <PERSON>Volcker</PERSON>'s reappointment to the Fed in mid-1983.
The sources said Baker respects <PERSON>Volcker</PERSON> and when appointed Treasury Secretary in February 1985, he decided to ensure a good working relationship, in part because he believed the two key government economic institutions have to work closely.
Regan, Treasury Secretary during President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s first term, was formerly head of Wall Street's largest brokerage firm Merrill Lynch and came to Washington determined to be America's pre-eminent economic spokesman.
He developed a deep antipathy for <PERSON>Volcker</PERSON>, whose political skills undermined that ambition, and who financial markets took much more seriously.
But the sources said <PERSON>Volcker</PERSON> would have to be invited to stay. "
And if <PERSON>Volcker</PERSON> left this Augsut, he would leave behind one of the most inexperienced Fed Boards in years.
Other potential candidates include economist Alan Greenspan, frequently an informal presidential economic adviser, New York Fed President E. Gerald Corrigan, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp chairman William Seidman, and <PERSON>Sprinkel</PERSON>.
Long a Regan protege, <PERSON>Sprinkel</PERSON>'s chances may be damaged by his patron's departure from the White House.
An aide to Agriculture Secretary <PERSON>Richard Lyng</PERSON> who asked not to be identified said there was nothing to substantiate the speculation, which he said was started by "somebody fanning the (wheat) market."

Quotas, the major device used to stabilize prices under the International Coffee Agreement, were suspended a year ago after prices soared following a damaging drought in <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE>.
The U.S. And <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE>, the largest coffee importer and exporter respectively, each laid the blame on the other for the breakdown of the talks.
Jon Rosenbaum, U.S. Assistant trade representative and delegate to the talks, said in a statement after the council adjourned, "A majority of producers, led by <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE>, were not prepared to negotiate a new distribution based on objective criteria. "
Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) President <PERSON>Jorio Dauster</PERSON> countered, "Negotiations failed because consumers tried to dictate quotas, not negotiate them."
Previously, quotas were determined by historical amounts exported, which gave <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE> a 30 pct share of a global market of about 58 mln 60-kilo bags.
But most consumers and a maverick group of eight producers proposed carving up the export market on the basis of exportable production and stocks, which would reduce <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE>'s share to 28.8 pct.
Consumer delegates said this method would reflect changes in many countries' export capabilities and make coffee more readily available to consumers when they need it. A last-minute attempt by <PLACE>Colombia</PLACE>, the second largest exporter, to rescue the talks with a compromise interim proposal could not bring the two sides together.
Delegates speculated <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE>'s financial problems, illustrated by its recent suspension of interest payments on bank debt, have increased political pressure on the country to protect its coffee export earnings.
Developing coffee-producing countries that depend heavily on coffee earnings, particularly some African nations and <PLACE>Colombia</PLACE>, are likely to be hurt the most by the ICO's failure to agree quotas, analysts said.

Central bank governor Chang Chi-cheng rejected a request by textile makers to halt the rise of the <PLACE>Taiwan</PLACE> dollar against the U.S. Dollar to stop them losing orders to South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore, a spokesman for the <PLACE>Taiwan </PLACE> Textile Federation said.
He quoted Chang as telling representatives of 19 textile associations last Saturday the government could not fix the <PLACE>Taiwan</PLACE> dollar exchange rate at 35 to one U.S. Dollar due to U.S. Pressure for an appreciation of the local currency.
It said the <PLACE>Taiwan</PLACE> dollar has risen almost 14 pct against the U.S. Dollar since September 1985 while the South Korean won climbed only four pct.
Many local bankers and economists predict <PLACE>Taiwan</PLACE>'s dollar will rise to between 32 and 33 per U.S. Dollar by year-end.
Chang was quoted as saying this would depend on <PLACE>Taiwan</PLACE>'s ability to reduce its trade surplus with the U.S. This year.
<PLACE>Taiwan</PLACE>'s textile exports fell by almost four pct in January to 562 mln U.S. Dlrs from 583 mln in January 1986, the same figures show.

The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) acted to tighten restrictions on microchip exports to countries other than the U.S. To preserve a U.S.- <PLACE>Japan</PLACE> pact on semiconductor trade, but major Japanese chipmakers doubt its usefulness.
Japanese firms and officials in turn argue the flow of cheap chips to third countries is due to grey-market sales by third-party brokers, who seek to profit from the gap between low prices in <PLACE>Japan</PLACE> and higher prices based on production costs and set for Japanese makers under the agreement.
<PLACE>Thailand</PLACE>'s improving economy will likely cause foreign reserves to increase to at least five billion dlrs by end-1987 from a record of nearly 4.2
Bank of <PLACE>Thailand</PLACE> statistics show foreign reserves rose to 3.95 billion at end-January from 3.03
Nimit Nonthapanthawat, chief economist at the &lt;Bangkok Bank Ltd>, said <PLACE>Thailand</PLACE>'s strong export performance, its relatively high interest rates, foreign participation in its stock market, and growing foreign investment, especially from Japan, contributed to the projected sharp rise.

The Federation of Bankers' Associations of <PLACE>Japan</PLACE> released its proposal for early creation of a comprehensive financial futures market in Tokyo.
Banking sources quoted federation chairman Yoshiro Araki as saying he hoped the market would be created as soon as possible because it would help promote the liberalisation of <PLACE>Japan</PLACE>'s financial markets.

<PLACE>Japan</PLACE> looks likely to allow U.S. Banks to conduct securities business here, a move that will probably cause the barriers separating Japanese commercial banks from brokerage houses to break down, financial analysts said.

They said the ministry will have to approve the U.S. Request soon to head off criticism its markets are not as open to foreigners as those of the U.S. Analysts said <PLACE>Japan</PLACE> has proceeded rapidly with financial deregulation since 1984, but has not touched upon the clear division between the securities and banking businesses.
Officials of major Japanese banks said they will pay special attention to the ministry's reaction to U.S. Bank requests because approval would accelerate market liberalization in <PLACE>Japan</PLACE>.

The project consists of a pipeline linking Nueva Teapa on the Gulf of <PLACE>Mexico</PLACE> with Salina Cruz on the Pacific Coast, and construction of the second phase of the Salina Cruz refinery.
The new pipeline will enable Japan to load <PLACE>Mexico</PLACE>'s Maya crude oil at Salina Cruz rather than in the Gulf of <PLACE>Mexico </PLACE>.
Pemex will also have some LPG surplus available in Salina Cruz that may help <PLACE>Japan</PLACE> diversify its supply sources of that product, he added.
<PLACE>China</PLACE> called on the United States to remove curbs on its exports, to give it favourable trading status and ease restrictions on exports of high technology.
The official International Business newspaper today published <PLACE>China</PLACE>'s demands in a editorial to coincide with the visit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz. "
The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice against favourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit <PLACE>China</PLACE> into the Generalised System of Preference (GSP). "Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports in recent years, control of them is still extremely strict and influences normal trade between the two countries," it added The paper also printed an article by <PLACE>China </PLACE>'s commercial counsellor in its Washington embassy, Chen Shibiao, who said that "all kinds of difficulties and restrictions" were preventing bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential.
The paper also printed a table showing that, since bilateral trade began in 1972, <PLACE>China</PLACE> has had a deficit every year except 1972 and 1977.
He said that, if <PLACE>China</PLACE> wants to obtain GSP status, it will have to lobby Congress itself to persaude it to amend several laws which currently prevent Peking getting such status.
The U.S. Trade Act of 1974 says that to qualify for GSP, <PLACE>China</PLACE> must be a member of the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade (GATT), for which it applied in July 1986, and "not be dominated or controlled by international Communism."
The official said <PLACE>China</PLACE> was well aware of the laws, some of which date to the anti-Communist early 1950's, but that there is not sufficient political will in the U.S. To change them.
<PLACE>China</PLACE> has been the subject of about a dozen cases involving anti-dumping in the U.S. Within the last two years, which the U.S. Side won, he said.
But, for the first time, <PLACE>China</PLACE> signed last week an agreement which it itself initiated to voluntarily restrain exports of at least two categories of steel goods, which may lead the U.S. Side to withdraw the anti-dumping case, he added.
<PLACE>China</PLACE> has the potential to disrupt world markets, especially in textiles.
Other GATT countries will be nervous about <PLACE>China</PLACE> in this respect.
Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania are members of GATT but none has <PLACE>China</PLACE>'s massive market potential for imports or its vast labour pool to produce cheap exports.
In a speech today in the northeast city of Dalian, U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz said his country welcomed <PLACE>China</PLACE>'s interest in participating in GATT. "
<PLACE>China</PLACE> can play an important role by actively joining GATT discussions seeking to expand general trading opportunities and enhance market access for exports worldwide.
<PLACE>China</PLACE> can further develop its foreign trade system so as to gain the maximum benefit from its GATT participation," he said.
The problems facing U.S.- <PLACE>China</PLACE> trade and GATT membership are similar -- a pricing system which many foreign businessmen regard as arbitrary and not related to actual costs, especially for exports, and a de facto dual currency system.
In a memorandum backing its application presented to GATT last month, <PLACE>China</PLACE> said it was gradually reforming its economic system and replacing mandatory instruction with "guidance planning" and economic levers.
The diplomat said that, to join GATT, <PLACE>China</PLACE> had much to do. REUTER &#3;

He quoted Chang as telling representatives of 19 textile associations last Saturday the government could not fix the <PLACE>Taiwan</PLACE> dollar exchange rate at 35 to one U.S. Dollar due to U.S. Pressure for an appreciation of the local currency.
President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s approval rating fell after the Tower Commission criticised his handling of the Iran arms scandal, a New York Times/CBS poll indicates.
The poll found 42 pct of those surveyed approved <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s handling of his job and 46 pct disapproved.
The approval rating was the lowest since January 1983, when 41 pct approved of the way <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> was doing his job.
Last week's White House shake-up has increased the odds that Federal Reserve Board chairman <PERSON>Paul Volcker</PERSON>, a symbol of strength in a government reeling from the arms-to-Iran scandal, will serve a third term, sources close to the Fed say.
But they said that no decision on the appointment, which must be filled this August, has been taken by the White House and <PERSON>Volcker</PERSON> too has not made up his mind.
Former White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan, who resigned last week when ex-senator Howard Baker was named as his replacement, was implacably opposed to <PERSON>Volcker</PERSON> and tried often to undermine him.
It is an open secret in Washington that Regan tried to ensure that <PERSON>Volcker</PERSON>, first appointed in 1979 by President Carter, will not be offered a third term by President Reagan.
Only Volcker's key allies in the Reagan administration, Vice-President George Bush and Treasury Secretary <PERSON>James Baker</PERSON>, kept Regan's recent maneuvering at bay, the sources said.
Sources close to the administration say Regan leaked a story, quickly shot down by others in the administration, that Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the council of economic advisers, had been chosen to replace <PERSON>Volcker</PERSON>.
The sources said New White House Chief of Staff Howard <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> has a very good relationship with his namesake at the Treasury Department and is likely to respect his views on the Fed chairmanship.
As a moderate Republican, Baker is also unlikely to share the right-wing's opposition to <PERSON>Volcker</PERSON>. "
This new White House is going to need all the strength it can get," said one source when asked about the possibility of <PERSON>Volcker</PERSON>'s reappointment.
<PERSON>Paul Volcker</PERSON> is deeply respected in financial markets both in the United States and around the world.
At a time when the stability of the dollar and the viability of major debtor nations are in question, <PERSON>Volcker</PERSON>'s departure would definitely undermine U.S. leadership, foreign exchange analysts say.
U.S. officials say <PERSON>Volcker</PERSON> works very closely with Treasury Secretary Baker on issues like international debt and global economic cooperation.
The two men seem only to differ on how far to deregulate the banking industry, but recent statements by <PERSON>Volcker</PERSON>, in which he adopted a more liberal attitude on deregulation, signalled the politically-independent central bank is coming around at least partially to the Treasury position.
And a recent statement by a Reagan administration official that the two men saw "exactly eye-to-eye" on the dollar was seen as an indication of <PERSON>Baker</PERSON>'s support for the Fed chairman.
Baker is understood to have played a key role in <PERSON>Volcker</PERSON>'s reappointment to the Fed in mid-1983.
The sources said Baker respects <PERSON>Volcker</PERSON> and when appointed Treasury Secretary in February 1985, he decided to ensure a good working relationship, in part because he believed the two key government economic institutions have to work closely.
He developed a deep antipathy for <PERSON>Volcker</PERSON>, whose political skills undermined that ambition, and who financial markets took much more seriously.
But the sources said <PERSON>Volcker</PERSON> would have to be invited to stay. "
And if <PERSON>Volcker</PERSON> left this Augsut, he would leave behind one of the most inexperienced Fed Boards in years.
Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro held separate meetings with French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur and Bank of France Governor <PERSON>Jacques de Larosiere</PERSON> on the second stage of a European mission to explain his country's latest debt crisis, French officials said.

<PLACE>Venezuela</PLACE> will limit new loans to 50 pct of the interest and principal it repays on its 31 billion dlr foreign debt, President Jaime Lusinchi told political leaders.
Speaking last night at a new session of congress, he said last week's agreement to reschedule 21 billion dlrs in public sector foreign debt at lower interest rates reflected <PLACE>Venezuela</PLACE>'s improved credit image. "
<PLACE>Venezuela</PLACE> agreed last Friday with its 13-bank advisory committee to lower the interest margin to 7/8 pct over libor from 1-1/8 and reduce amortisations in the next three years to 1.35 billion dlrs from 3.35

"To seize this new opportunity I have instructed our negotiators to begin presentation of our draft INF treaty text at Geneva tomoorrow," <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> said.

Dauster said stocks and exports to ICO members and non-members all need to be considered when setting quotas and that <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE> would like to apply the coffee pact with a set ratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings.
It is a "simplistic misconception that <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE> can dictate" policy to other producers.
But most delegates and traders said quotas before October are unlikely, while <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE>'s Dauster noted the ICO has continued although there were no quotas from 1972 to 1980.

The U.S. is sticking for the moment to its policy that <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE>, which two weeks ago suspended debt payments to private banks, should deal with its creditors and not with governments, U.S. officials said. "
I don't see any desire here to scurry around and help <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE> until we get a better sense of what they are trying to do," a senior administration official stated. "
<PLACE>Brazil</PLACE> has to do business through the banks at this point," said another official following an assessment of that country's latest debt crisis.
In a related development, small regional banks that have made loans to <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE> and other heavily-indebted Latin American countries, will meet with Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker here tomorrow.
<PLACE>Brazil</PLACE>, with about 108 billion dlrs in debt, shocked banks late last month when it stopped interest payments on 68 billion dlrs owed to them until it can work out its problems.
<PLACE>Brazil</PLACE>'s trade surplus, its main source of foreign exchange has dwindled in recent months, making it difficult to service its debt.
Funaro, who told reporters here that he wanted a political discussion with industrialized nations on <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE>'s debt problems in an effort to obtain more and faster lending from official sources, held discussions here on Friday with Volcker, Treasury Secretary James Baker and other officials.
Another senior administration official said he was perplexed by Funaro's decision to discuss the latest crisis with governments and not with creditor banks, at a time when <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE> is in danger of losing short-term credit lines. "
One official today described Funaro's argument as "nonsense," and said there had been a considerable flow of funds to <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE>, for which that country was in arrears.
Funaro has said <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE> acted to protect its reserves but wanted to avoid a confrontation.
The consensus among administration officials seems to be that <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE>'s latest debt crisis is the result of the domestic economic problems. "
<PLACE>Brazil</PLACE> is a special case, but there's no doubt they would not be in the mess they're in if they had not screwed-up their economic policy," a senior official added.
The sources added that Volcker, for his part, is dissatisfied with some major banks' refusal to make interest rate concessions to <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE> and other Latin American debtors, and would like to see smaller creditor banks take a more actve role in the rescheduling process.
In its World Production and Trade Report, the department said traders indicated <PLACE>China</PLACE> may lack supplies or be unwilling to sell at current low world prices.

EC sales to <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE> total about 225,000 tonnes during 1986/87 (July-June) in stark contrast to only 50,000 tonnes in the 1985/86 season, it said.
The increasing presence of EC wheat in <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE> comes at a time when the Brazilian Wheat Board, BWB, expects the wheat import market will expand to 3.4 mln tonnes from the current forecast of 3.0
Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said he felt a proposed takeover by <PLACE>Japan</PLACE>'s &lt;Fujitsu Ltd> of U.S.-based Fairchild Semiconductor Corp, a subsidiary of Schlumberger Ltd &lt;SLB>, should be carefully reviewed.

President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> nominated Federal Bureau of Investigation Director William Webster to be director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), in succession to ailing William Casey.
The announcement came one day after <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> withdrew the nomination of Deputy CIA Dirctor Robert Gates, who faced opposition in the Senate because of the CIA's role in the Iran-contra scandal. "
Bill Webster will bring a remarkable depth and breadth of experience as well as a remarkable record of achievement to this position," said <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> in a statement read by White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>, seeking to salvage his Central America policy from the Iran arms scandal, said a major U.S. economic program for the region was working but needed 500 mln dlrs more than originally planned.
The report, mandated by Congress, explains how the administration intends to carry out the recommendations of the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>-appointed Kissinger Commission, which in 1984 developed a blueprint for U.S. policy in the region that was meant to offset <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON>'s military aid program for Nicaraguan rebels.
The Soviet Union and its allies have provided the Sandinista regime military hardware and sufficient economic aid to keep <PLACE>Nicaragua</PLACE>'s failed economy afloat," Reagan said.

<PLACE>Greece</PLACE> aims to reduce foreign borrowing to 1.6 or 1.7
billion in 1986, and will use some of the funds to make early debt servicing payments, the Governor of the Bank of Greece, <PERSON>Dimitris Halikias</PERSON>, said.
He told reporters this year's borrowing forecast exceeded immediate needs, but <PLACE>Greece</PLACE> wanted to take advantage of low international interest rates in order to make servicing payments at a lower cost.
<PLACE>Greece</PLACE>'s foreign debts totalled 16.8
billion at end-1985, <PERSON>Halikias</PERSON> said.
He said the extra funds available to <PLACE>Greece</PLACE> this year will go towards servicing debts falling due after 1990.
He said <PLACE>Greece</PLACE> was able to cut borrowing because a two-year austerity program it adopted in October, 1985 cut its current account deficit to 1.75 billion dlrs last year from a record 3.3
<PERSON>Halikias</PERSON> said he was "fairly optimistic" Greece would reach a current account deficit target of 1.25

Secretary of Commerce Malcolm Baldrige expressed concern about the continuing U.S. trade deficits with South Korea and <PLACE>Taiwan</PLACE> and said that without an adjustment in exchange rates there is little likelihood of improvement.
I feel that unless we see an exchange rate adjustment we probably won't be able to see much of a change in the large surplus that <PLACE>Taiwan</PLACE> in particular has with us," he said.
In a wide-ranging discussion on U.S. trade matters, Baldrige also repeated U.S. concern about an attempted takeover by <PLACE>Japan</PLACE>'s Fujitsu company of Fairchild Computer.
Lastly, Baldrige said that the United States was hopeful that it could complete a free market agreement with <PLACE>Canada</PLACE> by the autumn, but said major issues, including acid rain, remained unresolved.

At the ICO talks major consuming nations, led by the U.S., proposed that future coffee export quota shares be calculated by a formula incorporating a producer's recent exportable production and verified stocks, while large producers led by <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE> proposed maintaining the traditional ad hoc division of shares.
The consumer position would have in effect reduced the market share of <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE>, by far the world's largest producer.
involved in coffee policy said they are bracing for a diplomatic and coffee market offensive from producer countries, led by Brazil and <PLACE>Colombia</PLACE>, to soften the consumer position. "
Knowing that its next crop is fairly large, <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE> will kind of want to test the resolve of other producers and consumers," said one U.S. official.
The U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, said Brazil and <PLACE>Colombia</PLACE> may flood the coffee market in the next few months in an effort to drive down prices and pressure other countries, particularly the splinter group of small producers who differed with the major producers in London.
El Salvador and <PLACE>Guatemala</PLACE> both backed Brazil and Colombia at the London talks in resisting pressures for quotas based on objective criteria.
There is a strong feeling among some in the State Department that the United States should continue to support the splinter group of producers who have taken the politically-risky step of opposing <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE> on the objective criteria question, U.S. officials said.
In London, the U.S. was supported by the U.K., the <PLACE>Netherlands</PLACE>, West Germany, Japan, Australia and New Zealand on the issue of objective criteria, U.S. officials said.
However, U.S. sources said West Germany's support was at times qualified and there is some concern that the <ORG>European Community</ORG> could come under pressure to be more accommodative to producers in future talks.
While political manuevering by small producers and consuming countries will be important, U.S. officials said the key to any future outcome will be <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE>'s position.
U.S. officials blamed <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE>'s intransigence for the failure of the talks and said a more flexible position from Brasilia would be the most important step toward agreement.

Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro met his Swiss counterpart Otto Stich, Swiss Economics Minister Jean-Pascal Delamuraz and National Bank President <PERSON>Pierre Languetin</PERSON> on the fourth leg of a tour to discuss his country's debt problems.
Funaro said a mechanism would have to be found to end <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE>'s debt crisis but it would not be easy.
<PLACE>Brazil</PLACE> would not repeat the measures it took in response to its debt crisis of 1982, which he said had provoked the biggest recession in his country's history, he added.
He said European and Japanese banks were showing a more flexible attitude towards <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE>'s problems than U.S. Banks and it was difficult to discuss capitalisation with the latter.
Funaro, who travels to Italy this evening, said it was unclear if he would go to Japan on Friday or return to <PLACE>Brazil</PLACE> first.

Tigrel, whose department produces the annual programme which is central to the government's economic planning, said <PLACE>Turkey</PLACE>'s creditworthiness was at risk over the current account shortfall, originally targeted at 695 mln dlrs. "We must alleviate the current account substantially to sustain the creditworthiness that we have managed to secure over the last five years," he added.
His comment echoed last October's <ORG>Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development</ORG> report on Turkey, which said Ankara's case for more medium-term financing on better terms would look better if inflation were lower and the current account deficit cut or turned into a surplus. "

Central Bank director Daniel Marx said <PLACE>Argentina</PLACE>'s creditor banks were divided on the country's request for rescheduling its foreign debt. "
<PLACE>Argentina</PLACE>'s great efforts to comply with obligations on its 50 billion dlr foreign debt should be met by a reduction in interest rates on the part of the creditor banks, he said.
Marx is in New York with <PLACE>Argentina</PLACE>'s debt negotiating team holding talks with the creditor banks' steering committee.

Colombian finance minister Cesar Gaviria blamed an inflexible U.S. position for the failure of last week's <ORG>International Coffee Organisation</ORG>, ICO, talks on export quotas. "
Gaviria stressed that <PLACE>Colombia</PLACE> tried to ensure a successful outcome of the London talks but he deplored that intransigent attitudes, both from producing and consuming nations, made it impossible.
In a conversation later with local journalists, Gaviria said the U.S. attitude would have serious economic and political consequences, not necessarily for a country like <PLACE>Colombia</PLACE> but certainly for other Latin American nations and for some African countries.
He told Reuters that <PLACE>Colombia</PLACE>, because of the relatively high level of its coffee stocks, would probably suffer less.
