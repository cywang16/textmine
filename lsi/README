 This directory contains all the files to run a SVD on a 
 term document matrix.  The code has been modified to run with some 
 Perl code that loads the matrix and reads the data from text files. 

 Files		Description
 --------------------------------------------------------------
 lao2		Output file containing U matrix, sigma values, and V matrix
 lap2		Input parameter file to run SVD
 las2		UNIX executable (create using the makefile)
 las2.c		Modified source for las2
 las2.exe	Windows executable (built using gcc on cygwin)
 las2.h		Header file for las2.c
 lav2		Binary output file
 makefile	Makefile to compile and create the executable
 matrix		Term document matrix in the Boeing-Hartwell format

 To run las2:

 1. Create the matrix file

 2. Set the parameter file - lap2

 3. On Windows, you need the las2.exe executable and on Linux
    you can create the executable using the makefile

 4. To run a test from the command line, pass the full directory 
    path to the LSI input files with a trailing slash 

    a) las2 /home/user1/lsi/

          or

    b) las2.exe C:\lsi\
