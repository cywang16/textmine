 Some of the code in this directory is taken from the SVDPACKC package 
 from the University of Tennessee. The entire package
 can be downloaded from http://www.netlib.org/svdpack/.  One of the 
 modules, las2.c has been modified to dump the matrices for a Perl script.

 The single vector Lanczos method has been used to compute the SVD of a matrix.
