                     Installing Text Mine

 0. Pre-Installation Setup

 In Linux and Windows platforms, the perl executable should be found in the PATH env. variable and the user should have permission to create directories. 

 The installation script will attempt to install the following Perl modules on request -

 1. Crypt::Rot13
 2.  DBI
 3.  DBD::mysql
 4.  Digest::MD5
 5.  HTML::Parser
 6.  XML::RSS::Parser
 7.  GD

 These modules can be pre-loaded to avoid running the installation script multiple times. Sample output from installation scripts is shown in the docs directory.

 MySql: The userid and password specified in utils/setup.pl 
 must have permissions to create a database and look
 up the mysql database tables. 

 (SEE NOTE 3. below if you are using MySql 4.1 and above.)

 1. Description:  

 To intall, run install.sh on Linux or install.bat on Windows.

 2. Minimum Requirements:

 Apache (Version 1.3.?), Perl (5.6), and MySql (3.22)
 Tested on Linux (Fedora Core), Suse Linux, Windows XP, and Windows 2000.

 The MySql server should be available to install the text 
 mining dictionaries and create a database.

 3. Changes for Mysql 4.1 and upwards 

  In utils/setup.pl and utils/load_tab.pl change replace in the 
  load statement to ignore.

  The hash length of the password for Mysql users was increased in 
  version 4.1 and upwards. Use either solution a. or b.

  a. In the [mysqld] section of the my.ini file add the following -

     old-passwords

     on a single line and then install Text Mine to use the shorter 
     passwords or

  b. Use the OLD_PASSWORD function to reduce the length of the password hash
     (see http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/old-client.html)

     Changes to utils/tables.sql
     UPDATE mysql.user SET Password = OLD_PASSWORD('tmpass') WHERE 
            User = 'tmadmin';
     UPDATE mysql.user SET Password = OLD_PASSWORD('tmpass') WHERE 
            User = 'tmuser';

  AND

     change cgi-bin/co_login.pl to use OLD_PASSWORD instead of PASSWORD 
     in the check_password subroutine, if my.ini was NOT changed. 

 4. Installation:

 You will need: 

 - Directory names for the root (installation) directory,
 web directory, cgi directory, and icons

 During installation:

 - Several dependent modules maybe downloaded -
    1.  Crypt::Rot13 (optional)
    2.  DBI
    3.  DBD-mysql
    4.  Digest::MD5
    5.  HTML::Parser
    6.  GD (optional)

 - The database and tables are created and loaded with dictionary
   data. Platform dependent code is copied.

 - CGI Scripts and icons are moved to specified web directories
